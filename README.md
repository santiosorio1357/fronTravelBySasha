Vue Light Bootstrap Dashboard is built on top of Bootstrap 4, Vuejs and Vue-router. To get started do the following steps:
1. Download the project
2. Make sure you have node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
3. Type `npm install` in the source folder where `package.json` is located
4. Type `npm run dev` to start the development server

The repo uses [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) scaffolding which takes care of the development setup with webpack and all the necessary modern tools to make web development faster and easier.
